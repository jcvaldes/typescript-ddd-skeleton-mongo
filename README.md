# TypeScript mongo basic skeleton

For now, you have all the code example available in this other repository: https://github.com/jcvaldes/typescript-ddd-skeleton-mongo

The idea is that we'll move the basic parts (folder structure and bare minimum code to serve as skeleton) to this repository (`typescript-ddd-skeleton-mongo`)
